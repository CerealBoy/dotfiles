  "readme": "# environment [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/atom-community/environment.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/atom-community/environment)\n\nA package for the [Atom Editor](https://atom.io) that provides a normalized environment as a service to other packages. The service can be consumed by placing the following in your `package.json` file:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"your-package-name\",\n  \"main\": \"./lib/main\",\n  \"<...>\": \"<other parts of your package.json here>\",\n  \"consumedServices\": {\n    \"environment\": {\n      \"versions\": {\n        \"1.0.0\": \"consumeEnvironment\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThen, in your `main.js` file, add the following:\n\n```javascript\nconsumeEnvironment (environment) {\n  this.environment = environment\n}\n```\n\nThe environment is a hash, of the same format as that provided by `process.env`.\n\n## What Does This Package Actually Do?\n\nOn platforms other than Mac OS X, the environment that this package provides is identical to `process.env`.\n\nOn Mac OS X, a check is made to determine whether `atom` was launched from a terminal, or if it was launched via `Dock`, `Finder`, `Spotlight`, or `open` (i.e. `launchctl` launched processes).\n\nIf `atom` was launched by a `launchctl` launched process, the environment available to `atom` is anaemic. This is particularly problematic for packages that depend on a sane environment to function correctly (e.g. anything that launches an external process).\n\nIf the environment is not sane, this package will launch the user's shell (as defined in `process.env.SHELL`) and then run `env` from that shell. The resulting environment is captured and then provided to any consumer of this service.\n\nThis package will also delete the `DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES` environment variable (if set) from the environment on OS X.\n",
