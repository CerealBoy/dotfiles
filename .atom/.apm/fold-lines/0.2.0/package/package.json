Therefore, to modify the style of the line marker, you could do something\nlike this in your styles.less file:\n\n```sass\natom-text-editor::shadow .line.folded {\n  border-bottom: 1px dashed salmon;  // Mmm.. salmon..\n}\n```\n\nTo remove underline from the line number marker:\n```sass\natom-text-editor::shadow .line-number.folded {\n  border-bottom: none;\n}\n```\n\nTo hide default fold marker (which I feel to be redundant while fold lines are visible):\n```sass\natom-text-editor::shadow .fold-marker {\n  display: none;\n}\n```\n\n### Goals / TODO:\n* [ ] Write specs\n* [ ] Config option to hide default fold marker\n* [ ] Fold lines in minimap.  Hmm&hellip;\n* [ ] Get mainline Atom to include this\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/alysov/fold-lines/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/alysov/fold-lines#readme","_id":"fold-lines@0.2.0","_shasum":"11cd9823bdecdb6e0e0e43ea45270fa0b2bdf4dc","_resolved":"file:../d-11663-14063-12aj1l6/package.tgz","_from":"../d-11663-14063-12aj1l6/package.tgz"}
